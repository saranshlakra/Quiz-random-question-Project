# Quiz-random-question-Project
This random question quiz containing four different questions with multiple option.
Basically it is a MCQ quiz.
I used fn constructor and different methods and function in it.
There are many ways of doing it but as I am learing these concepts, so I applied here.
You need to reload the webpage to get new question.
Your answer ( correct or incorrect ) will be displayed in the console.
So please hit ctrl+shift+i and than click console to take the quiz. :)
